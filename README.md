Project Title: User Review-Based Ranking System for Bakeries

Project Description:
The goal of this data science project is to develop a ranking system for bakeries based on user reviews. The project will leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze and extract valuable insights from user-generated content. By aggregating and analyzing user reviews, the project aims to provide an objective and comprehensive ranking of bakeries in a given area.

The project will involve the following steps:

  1.  Data Collection: Obtain a large dataset of user reviews for bakeries from various online platforms, such as review websites, social media, and mobile applications. The dataset should include information such as the bakery name, location, review text, rating, and date.

  2.  Data Preprocessing: Clean the raw review data by removing irrelevant information, handling misspellings, and standardizing the text format. Perform text normalization techniques, such as lowercasing, stop-word removal, and lemmatization, to ensure consistency.

   3.  Sentiment Analysis: Utilize sentiment analysis techniques to classify user reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. This step will involve training a machine learning model on a labeled dataset to identify sentiment polarity based on the review text. Additionally, extract other sentiment-related features, such as sentiment intensity and emotion classification.

   4. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the user reviews to capture different aspects of the bakery experience. These features may include the quality of products, service, ambiance, pricing, and variety of offerings. Use NLP techniques, such as keyword extraction, topic modeling, and named entity recognition, to identify and quantify these features.

   5. Ranking Algorithm: Develop a ranking algorithm that considers various factors derived from user reviews, such as sentiment scores, feature ratings, and review recency. Experiment with different ranking methods, such as weighted averages or machine learning algorithms, to determine the most effective approach.

   6. Visualization: Visualizations, such as word clouds or bar charts, can be used to highlight key aspects of the rankings.
